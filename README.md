### Description

Images Steganography using DWT algorithm

### How does it work?

## Step by step

- [x] DWT transform
- [x] Blocking
- [x] Matching
- [x] Block differences computation
- [x] Block replacement
- [x] Rearrange coefficients blocks
- [x] Inverse DWT transform

### Disclaimer

Right now only work with [PPM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm), mainly P6 since it's easier to work with raw data in PPM format, maybe add support for other images type if I have free time.
