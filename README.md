### How does it work?

## Step by step

- DWT transform
- Blocking
- Matching
- Block difference computation
- Block replacement
- Re-arrange co-efficients blocks
- Reverse DWT transform

Right now only work with [PPM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm), mainly P6, maybe add support for other images type if I have free time.
